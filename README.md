Assumptions/Notes:
1. to run the cache, paste all files in the python directory (the one that contains the python files required to run programs in python, like DLLs, doc, include, Lib, etc.)
    e.g. D:\Python
2. open the command prompt, type-> python zy1.py
3. give inputs as per your choice
4. i have provided a filled cache for your convenience. however to empty and start fresh, kindly delete the contect of 'cache.txt' and 'id_info.txt' files
5. it is saved to external file on exit, along with data associated with that atudent ID
6. the concept of a queue has been used implicitly to implement the LRU cache
7. CRUD is supported by default, except for delete cache operation
8. to change cache size for faster checking, look for comments in program to change it
9. i have programmed the cache to print out phrases that will help in understanding the working of the cache, also, the program, on running, is pretty intuitive and requires least     assistance
